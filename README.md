# Download
Because it requires the use of the **"Windows. h"** header library in **C++** for key clicking, so **Windows Defender** will consider it a virus as a normal phenomenon.
# File path form
Please use **single** backslash to separate file path.  
The file name **must** include a suffix.  
The file name can include quotes.

For example:  
  `C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\main.adofai` is **legal**.  
  `"C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\main.adofai"` is **legal**.  
  `C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\main.adofai` is **illegal**.  
  `C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\main` is **illegal**.
